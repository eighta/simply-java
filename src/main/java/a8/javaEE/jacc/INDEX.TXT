Java Authorization Contract for Containers

The Java Authorization Contract for Containers (JACC) specification defines a contract between a Java EE application server
and an authorization policy provider. All Java EE containers support this contract.

The JACC specification defines java.security.Permission classes that satisfy the Java EE authorization model.
The specification defines the binding of container access decisions to operations on instances of these permission classes.
It defines the semantics of policy providers that use the new permission classes to address the authorization requirements
of the Java EE platform, including the definition and use of roles.

Java Authentication Service Provider Interface for Containers

The Java Authentication Service Provider Interface for Containers (JASPIC) specification defines
a service provider interface (SPI) by which authentication providers that implement message authentication mechanisms
may be integrated in client or server message-processing containers or runtimes.

Authentication providers integrated through this interface operate on network messages provided to them
by their calling container. The authentication providers transform outgoing messages so that the source of the message
can be authenticated by the receiving container, and the recipient of the message can be authenticated by the message sender.

Authentication providers authenticate incoming messages and return to their calling container the identity established
as a result of the message authentication.

JASPIC is new to the Java EE 6 platform.
